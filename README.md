# Helsinki University - Full Stack Open 2021

Worked on learning modern full stack web development with React, NodeJS, Express and MongoDb with a small introduction to GraphQL, Redux and Typescript.

## Two basic example projects

- Phonebook app
  - Simple application where user can filter people from the database, add a new person to the phonebook and delete person as well
  - First full stack project with very little styling
  - [Frontend source code](https://github.com/halmemiika/fullstackopen/tree/main/osa2/puhelinluettelo) and [Backend source code](https://github.com/halmemiika/fullstackopen/tree/main/osa3/puhelinluettelo)
  - [Live site hosted with heroku](https://fierce-springs-73136.herokuapp.com/)

- Blog app
  - Another simple full stack application where user can add new blogs and comment on those. Also user can delete only his own blogs
  - Styled with [material-ui](https://mui.com/)
  - Has few bugs as well as missing features but the core functionality works
  - [Frontend source code](https://github.com/halmemiika/fullstackopen/tree/main/osa5/bloglist-frontend)
  - [Backend source code](https://github.com/halmemiika/fullstackopen/tree/main/osa4/bloglist-backend)
  - [Live site](https://limitless-sea-57421.herokuapp.com/) with testing account
